# Zakaria A. Khan's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository!

I am a final-year student at **Wayne State University**, majoring in **Physics** and **Chemistry**. This website serves as an online portfolio where I share information about my academic background, research interests, and achievements.

## About Me

I have had the privilege of interning at federal laboratories and universities, which led to me being named a **Goldwater Scholar**. Additionally, I have received **research funding abroad** as a **Fulbright Scholar**. My primary interests lie in the fields of **light-matter interactions** and **experimental quantum information**.

You can find more details about my work and experiences through the following sections:

- **[My Resume](./zk_resume.pdf)** – Learn more about my academic and professional background.
- **[My GitHub](https://github.com/zakaria-a-khan)** – Explore my repositories and research projects.

### Quantum Chemistry Calculations

As moreso a way for me to familiarize myself with github, repositories, etc., I've included a couple sets of basic quantum chemistry calculations that I have performed using density functional theory and hartree-foch. Below are some of the details and results.

#### Styrene Calculations

In the **styrene** calculations, I used Gaussian software to explore molecular properties. These calculations involved:

- Geometry optimization and electronic structure analysis
- Vibrational frequency analysis
- Dipole moment and Mulliken charge calculations
- Electrostatic potential mapping

You can find the detailed files and results in the **[styrene submission files](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files)** folder. This includes:

- **[Styrene molecule image](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene.png)**
- **[Styrene charge distribution](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_charge.png)**
- **[Styrene HOMO orbital](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_homo.PNG)**
- **[Styrene LUMO orbital](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_lumo.PNG)**
- **[Styrene Mulliken charges and dipole moment](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_mulliken_charges.png)**
- **[Styrene electrostatic potential map](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_electrostaticV.png)**

#### Formaldehyde Calculations

For my formaldehyde calculations, I used **HF/3-21G** and **B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)** levels of theory to compute vibrational frequencies and thermochemical properties. The calculations involved:

- **Geometry optimization** and vibrational frequency calculations at both HF/3-21G and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels.
- **Thermochemical corrections** for zero-point energy, thermal correction to enthalpy, and free energy.
- **Comparison of experimental and theoretical frequencies** for formaldehyde.

You can find the relevant files and results in the **[formaldehyde submission files](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files)** folder. These include:

- **[Formaldehyde B3LYP log archive](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_b3lyp_log_archive.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde HF log archive](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_hf_log_archive.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde B3LYP vibrational frequencies](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_b3lyp_vibrational_freq.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde HF vibrational frequencies](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_hf_vibrational_freq.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde B3LYP thermochemistry](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_b3lyp_thermochem.PNG)**

### Physics Vida: Review of Theory (Beginning March 2025)

**Physics Vida** is my recent initiative to review core topics in physics in preparation for graduate school (qualifying exams, etc) and continued study. The initiative will focus on three key areas via their respective texts, listed below:

1. **Classical Mechanics**: Goldstein, Poole, Safko (3rd Ed)
2. **Electrodynamics**: Griffiths, Schroeter (3rd Ed)
3. **Quantum Mechanics**: Griffiths (5th Ed)

For full transparency, the texts were all sourced as pdf's from one of the following open-source sites:
1. https://libgen.li
2. https://annas-archive.org 

Note that the libgen umbrella is constantly taking down and putting up new url's so if these links are unavailable at any time, reddit likely has more updated url's.

#### Plan:
- Review **10 pages/day** from each of the three texts. So in total **30 pages/day** of material.
- Goal: Complete all three texts by term end in May 2025.
- Duration: **60 days** (starting March 1, 2025).
- Time: Approx. **3 hours/day** for reading and working problems.
- Extension: Spend the summer on more advanced, graduate level theory texts in optics, advanced quantum physics.

#### Weekly Progress Updates:
I'll track my progress in a weekly log, summarizing what I’ve covered and key concepts learned. May include notes but may be difficult because all my notes are hand-written.

#### Progress Log:

**March 1–7:**
- Classical Mechanics: 70 pages completed
- Electrodynamics: 70 pages completed
- Quantum Mechanics: 70 pages completed

Key Concepts:
- Classical Mechanics: Newtonian Mechanics, Lagrangian Formulation
- Electrodynamics: Gauss's Law, Electric Potential
- Quantum Mechanics: Wave-Particle Duality, Operators

#### Physics Vida Resources:

- **Notes**: [Link to Notes Folder]
- **Problems/Examples**: [Link to Problems Folder]

### Fitness

I got considerably lazy during the first few years of college and at the turn of the year I decided to up my cardiovascular fitness. To hold myself accountable, I track my running progress in [`running_log.md`](running_log.md). This includes distances, times, and notes.

Future extensions include adding more wholistic cardiovascular activities (swimming, etc), and attending amateur competitions (half-marathons, etc). While I don't touch weights, I'm also beginning to incorporate calesthenics and body-weight resistance exercises.
