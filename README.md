# Zakaria A. Khan's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository!

I am a final-year student at **Wayne State University**, majoring in **Physics** and **Chemistry**. This website serves as an online portfolio where I share information about my academic background, research interests, and professional achievements.

## About Me

I have had the privilege of interning at federal laboratories and universities, which led to me being named a **Goldwater Scholar**. Additionally, I have received **research funding abroad** as a **Fulbright Scholar**. My primary interests lie in the fields of **light-matter interactions** and **experimental quantum information**.

You can find more details about my work and experiences through the following sections:

- **[My GitHub](https://github.com/zakaria-a-khan)** – Explore my repositories and research projects.

## Quantum Chemistry Calculations

This repository includes several sets of quantum chemistry calculations that I have performed. Below are the details of the most recent work I have done.

### Styrene Calculations

In the **styrene** calculations, I used Gaussian software to explore molecular properties. These calculations involved:

- Geometry optimization and electronic structure analysis
- Vibrational frequency analysis
- Dipole moment and Mulliken charge calculations
- Electrostatic potential mapping

You can find the detailed files and results in the **[styrene submission files](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files)** folder. This includes:

- **[Styrene molecule image](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene.png)**
- **[Styrene charge distribution](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_charge.png)**
- **[Styrene HOMO orbital](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_homo.png)**
- **[Styrene LUMO orbital](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_lumo.png)**
- **[Styrene Mulliken charges and dipole moment](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_mulliken_charges.png)**
- **[Styrene electrostatic potential map](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/styrene_submission_files/styrene_electrostaticV.png)**

### Formaldehyde Calculations

For my formaldehyde calculations, I used **HF/3-21G** and **B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)** levels of theory to compute vibrational frequencies and thermochemical properties. The calculations involved:

- **Geometry optimization** and vibrational frequency calculations at both HF/3-21G and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels.
- **Thermochemical corrections** for zero-point energy, thermal correction to enthalpy, and free energy.
- **Comparison of experimental and theoretical frequencies** for formaldehyde.

You can find the relevant files and results in the **[formaldehyde submission files](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files)** folder. These include:

- **[Formaldehyde B3LYP log archive](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_b3lyp_log_archive.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde HF log archive](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_hf_log_archive.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde B3LYP vibrational frequencies](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_b3lyp_vibrational_freq.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde HF vibrational frequencies](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_hf_vibrational_freq.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde B3LYP thermochemistry](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_b3lyp_thermochem.PNG)**
- **[Formaldehyde NIST thermochemistry experimental data](./quantum_chemistry_calculations/formaldehyde_submission_files/formaldehyde_nist_thermochem_exp.PNG)**

### Additional Notes

- The theoretical vibrational frequencies tend to be higher than experimental values, with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) giving results closer to the experimental frequencies.
- The thermochemical corrections and vibrational frequencies for formaldehyde at different levels of theory are provided in the screenshots and tables linked above.
