# Zakaria A. Khan's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository!

I am a final-year student at **Wayne State University**, majoring in **Physics** and **Chemistry**. This website serves as an online portfolio where I share information about my academic background, research interests, and professional achievements.

## About Me

I have had the privilege of interning at federal laboratories and universities, which led to me being named a **Goldwater Scholar**. Additionally, I have received **research funding abroad** as a **Fulbright Scholar**. My primary interests lie in the fields of **light-matter interactions** and **experimental quantum information**.

You can find more details about my work and experiences through the following sections:

- **[My Resume](./zk_resume.pdf)** – Learn more about my academic and professional background.
- **[My GitHub](https://github.com/zakaria-a-khan)** – Explore my repositories and research projects.

## Quantum Chemistry Calculations

I have also completed a series of quantum chemistry calculations for a course I took. Below is an overview of the steps involved and corresponding screenshots.

### 1. Molecule Visualization

The molecule I chose for my calculations is **styrene**, visualized using GaussView. The image shows the atom numbering used in the Gaussian calculation.

### 2. Gaussian Calculation Details

The Gaussian archive entry at the end of the output shows the details of my calculation and the total energy (6 decimal places).

### 3. Molecular Orbitals

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and its energy:

### 4. Mulliken Charges and Dipole Moment

Here are the Mulliken charges (2 decimal places, atom numbers) and the dipole moment:
